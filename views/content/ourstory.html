                        A certain freedom needs to be given for kids to explore, discover and find out about things themselves. I also felt that it is very essential to integrate outdoor learning along with classroom learning. Within a community of schools we wanted to make
                        some space for some space for children. My husband and I wanted to create an educational environment that we would be honoured to send our child to.That’s when we came up with the idea of The Weavers Preschool. The Weavers Preschool,
                        derives its name from the weaver bird. On close observation of the bird’s behaviour and survival skills you would find  that they are social and gregarious birds. They move often and build nests with a distinct intelligence- as
                        an intricate net of connections that serves to provide safety, adaptability and ease of migrating to new terrains.We at The Weavers Preschool not only want our wee kids to be as smart, artistic and intricate as the weaver bird
                        but we also want to teach them how to fly freely and confidently into the real world.
