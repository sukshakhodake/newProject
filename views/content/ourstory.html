                        A certain freedom needs to be given for kids to explore, discover and find out about things themselves. I also felt that it is very essential to integrate outdoor learning along with classroom learning. Within a community of schools we wanted to make
                        some space for some space for children. My husband and I wanted to create an educational environment that we would be honoured to send our child to.That’s when we came up with the idea of The Weavers Preschool. The Weavers Preschool,
                        derives its name from the weaver bird. On close observation of the bird’s behaviour and survival skills you would find  that they are social and gregarious birds. They move often and build nests with a distinct intelligence- as
                        an intricate net of connections that serves to provide safety, adaptability and ease of migrating to new terrains.We at The Weavers Preschool not only want our wee kids to be as smart, artistic and intricate as the weaver bird
                        but we also want to teach them how to fly freely and confidently into the real world.

                                and their creativity, giving them an exposure with loads of activities along with their mommies to instil in them that learning is fun and learning happens through all their senses.

                            Pre Nursery is the first exposure in the long educational journey of every child. It is here that the seeds of a happy schooling are sowed. Thus Pre Nursery is an all important year. At Weavers we will ensure this journey has the right beginning and is
                            steeped in engaging activities to develop a positive attitude towards learning. Children will learn about the world around them and the basic numbers and letters of the alphabet. Music and movement forms a large part of the
                            pre nursery day Large fine and motor development also happens with the help of our large number of outdoor and indoor activities.

                            At this age children start becoming social and enjoy the company of their friends and interact more with each other. Social development is stepped up and children are engaged in small and large group activities. This helps create an environment for learning
                            the nuances of social behaviour – manners, etiquettes and acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. They start exploring various mediums to express their creativity. Information is provided for a deeper understanding of things
                            around them. As they learn and sing new songs and rhymes during music and movement they also explore musical instruments that create different sounds. Pre-reading and pre-writing activities become complex and pre-mathematics
                            is added.
